# 2020 Honours Stage Project
 Developed Program and Report Submission for 2020 Honours Stage Project University Dissertation
 
This was my 2020 Honours Year project submission and dissertation developing a game demo in virtual reality. This made use of an old Steam VR intergration as the basis for VR control and navigation. This is admittedly poor work with a lot of external factors effecting the work and end product at the time.
